### Interval
Sort start or end, if merge all overlap sort start.
   
56. Merge Intervals
57. Insert Interval
435. Non-overlapping Intervals
452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons


### Heap Sort
Min-Heap: Smallest element at the root; parent nodes are smaller than their children.(x as default)
Max-Heap: Largest element at the root; parent nodes are larger than their children.(-x)
#### Min-heap
215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
2336. Smallest Number in Infinite Set
2542. Maximum Subsequence Score
2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers


### Array sort
347. Top K Frequent Elements
692. Top K Frequent Words


### Merge sort
88. Merge Sorted Array


### Quick sort
3011. Find if Array Can Be Sorted


### Sorting Algorithm
912. Sort an Array
##### Summary
Insertion: Stable | T: O(n^2) for worst&average, O(n) for best because already sorted | x <= pivot | pivot | unsort



bubble sort: compare adjacent. best O(n) sorted, no swap, exit early; worst O(n^2), reverse sort
quick sort: divide and conquer recursion. partition, pivot. best O(nlogn), worst O(n*2) when repeated 
merge sort: divide and conquer recursion. T&S O(nlogn).
heap sort: best/worst O(nlogn)
selection sort: not stable since sorted in not original order. O(n^2). find minV, swap with cur, keep [: minIndex+1] are sorted










703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream

#### Max Heap
451. Sort Characters By Frequency
506. Relative Ranks
973. K Closest Points to Origin
1046. Last Stone Weight

### Merge sort
1768. Merge Strings Alternately(PENDING)


1464. Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array
2335. Minimum Amount of Time to Fill Cups
2558. Take Gifts From the Richest Pile
